**App Store Description**

In life, we come across many flavours. For some, there's nothing that can compare to an ultimate classic burger. Throughout time man has made many burgers, what makes a burger great and where can you track it down?

Before today we couldn't do such a thing, it was next to impossible. Thanks to the Burgerdex we can now work together to catalogue burgers like a species and get a more in-depth knowledge of where our next meal may be coming from.

Uploading a new burger is a breeze. Like one found on a warm summers day standing beside the barbecue grilling up some patties. Just take a photo, add a description of your initial thoughts, rate the burger experience and go.
